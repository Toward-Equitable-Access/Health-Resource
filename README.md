# Toward Equitable Access: Leveraging Crowdsourced Reviews to Investigate Public Perceptions of Health Resource Accessibility

Access to health resources is an essential determinant of public well-being and societal resilience, particularly during public health emergencies when the demand for medical services and preventative care surges. Nevertheless, significant questions remain regarding the equitable accessibility of these resources across diverse demographic and geographic groups. Traditional survey methods often fall short due to limitations in spatial coverage, cost-effectiveness, and timeliness. Crowdsourcing through online reviews offers a complementary approach to address these challenges. This study highlights the potential of crowdsourced data by analyzing customer reviews on Google Maps to investigate public perceptions of health resource accessibility. It focuses on how disparities in perceived availability and quality of health resources manifest and evolve across the United States, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It also explores the relationship between these perceived patterns and key socioeconomic and demographic factors by analyzing their progression over three critical periods: Pre-Pandemic, Peak-Pandemic, and Post-Peak period. Our findings reveal clear disparities in public perceptions of health resource accessibility across the United States, with perceived disparities becoming more pronounced during the Peak-Pandemic period, followed by a slight reduction in the Post-Peak pandemic phase. Our results further indicate that factors like political affiliations, racial demographics, and educational attainment levels are particularly influential in shaping these perceptions. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions and policy measures to address inequities, fostering a more inclusive healthcare infrastructure that can better withstand future public health challenges.
